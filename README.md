# MiaowVexV5
This is a repo for Miaow team's files.

Please make sure you choose the correct game's folder and download it.
I'll be updating the folders when I make any changes and you can too (but I have to add you to the repo first.
Just make sure to let me know when editing to avoid any problems.

If you want to change variable ports, got to vairables.**cpp**.
You find the number of each port at the end. Just pick  a number between 1-21.
If you want to flip a motor, put ", true" after the port number.
For example: vex::motor(vex::PORT1, true);

If you have any requests or want to look at an overview of what I'm working on, go to projects
